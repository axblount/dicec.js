Dice combinators for javascript, [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/axblount/dicec/blob/master/LICENSE).

[dicec.js](https://github.com/axblount/dicec.js/blob/master/dicec.litcoffee) is written in Literate Coffeescript so you might as well read the file.

I wrote this a while ago. It needs to be cleaned up and documented.

```coffee
# Roll three six-sided die and sum them.
# 3d6
d(6).repeat(3).sum()
```
